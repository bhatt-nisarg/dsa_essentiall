//Backtracking Introduction

-it is a algorithmic technique
-recursively trying to build a solution
-seaching the entire search space to solve a computation problem


problem Types
1 - Decision Problem  
	check feasible solution
	for example whether a solution is possible or not

2 - Optimisation Problem
    find best solution
    we are given set of nodes and we have to findout a path which covers all the nods but in minimum cost(Example Traveling salesmen problem)
3 - Enumeration Problem 
    -find all solutions
    we are given string abc and we have to find out all the subset of the string or we have to find out all permutation of the string

Some classical problem in Backtracking
- Rate in maze
- N queen problem 
- sudoku solver
- knight's tour problem
