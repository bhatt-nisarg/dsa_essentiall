//Object Oriented Programming
//it all about style of writing code

Objects? 
Objcts = Entities in real world
Objects have two things
state(Date)
Behaviour(Function)
For exampple we have Pen class
class pen {
	string color //data
	int thickness//data
	setcolor() // Funnction
	setThickness //Function
}
in pen we have object like its color its thickness and
functions etc

next  example
car object 
class car {
	name 
	color
	model
	manufactured date
	checkout()
}


object make work of programmer is easy maintainable
Encaptulation(data hiding)
Protect against unauthorized access
inheritence
polymorphism
