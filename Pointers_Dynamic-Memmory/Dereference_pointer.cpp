//Dereference Operator  - dereference operator is denoted using *
//dereferecne operator is used when we have to access the value from their address then we use dereference operator
/*
	
	'*' is use in 3 way 
	1) Multiply numbers = 1*3,5*2 etc..
	2) use in pointer variable = datatype * ptr;
	3) use in dereference operator


if we use & before any means it gives address of a bucket
	&Bucket => Address
if we use * before any address it  gives bucket value
	*Address => Bucket


Dereference Operator '*' =>
	An interseting property of pointer is that they can be used to access the variable they point to directly.this is done by preceding the pointer name with
	the dereference operatoro(*). The operator it self can be read as "value pointed to by"


NULL Ptr => Sometimes it is usefult to make our pointers point to nothing. this is called a null pointer.
			we assign a pointer null value by setting it to address 0:

			int *p = 0;
			int *q = NULL;
